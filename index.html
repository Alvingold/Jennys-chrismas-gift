                <strong> To My Dearest Best Friend ,</strong><br>
                This Christmas, I wanted to do something special to show how much I really  appreciate you. Our friendship has been one of the most unexpected yet beautiful parts of my life. It started in such a surprising way, and tbh, I didn’t expect it to last this long. But here we are, still standing strong since August, and, honestly, I couldn’t be more grateful.
                I know I’ve not really been the best, but thank you for never giving up on me, even during my lowest moments. Especially the times when I wasn’t myself you stayed by my side, never turning away. Your kindness and unwavering support have meant everything to me. You’ve truly given me the kind of friendship I’ve always wanted, and I honestly can’t imagine my life without you in it.
                I made <a href="blooming flower/index.html" target="_blank" class="sparkle-link">this</a> as a way of saying thank you for being my best friend, for believing in me, and for bringing light into my life when I needed it most. I’m so lucky to have you.
                This Christmas, I want you to know just how much you mean to me and how i really appreciate you. I hope this season brings you as much happiness as you’ve brought me. With the New Year ahead, i pray we continue to stay close no matter the distance.I could have just sent it too you like a normal person would have done but i guess im not normal 🥲.
                Anyways, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, my love. I hope we’ll still be together for the next one. ❤️
